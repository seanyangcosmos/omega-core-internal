# M24: Semantic Alignment Tracker Module

## Module Purpose

The Semantic Alignment Tracker is designed to monitor and document semantic consistency among modules within the Sean Yang Core system. It ensures that evolving definitions, syntactic forms, and conceptual extensions across different modules remain aligned with the original core intents and logic.

## Core Functions

- Detect semantic drift between module versions (e.g., between M8 and M13).
- Visualize semantic chains and how meaning evolves across iterations.
- Log alignment events and significant divergence points.
- Provide meta-reports highlighting where structural coherence needs reinforcement.

## Implementation Notes

This module works in close coordination with:

- **M9: Pragmatic Assertion Guard** to ensure legitimacy.
- **M10: Integrity and Dependency Mapping** to visualize structure.
- **M17: Semantic Coherence Guard** to validate logic and coherence.
